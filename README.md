Hi,
This is anup singh.
I am a backend engineer who loves to write the structured code and likes to review my own code. I believe that their is no perfect design patterns for writing a scalable code. It's all depend upon the requirements/story of projects. So I always first try to solve the problem no matter it is scalable or not. Once I have solution than I start figuring out what is the best way to write my though which can be understable by machine and human as well. Thus, I am trying to do my best in this field and love to solve general small LLD problems.
